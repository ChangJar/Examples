How to use aes-file-encrypt.c

1)  Start by typing make
2)  Make a file to encode. Can be any file (ex. .txt .in .out .file etc.)
3)  run the excecutable, for help run with -h flag. Basic command is as follows:
        
        ./aes-file-encrypt <-option> <input.file> <output.file> <key(optional)>

    typing -e for option will encrypt the input.file onto the output.file.
    typing -d for option will decrypt the input.file onto the output.file.
        NOTE: When decrypting make sure the key is the same used for the 
        encryption, otherwise it won't decode correctly. Which is the idea.
        Only those with the key will be able to decode the message. If no
        key is entered into the command line, it will use "0123456789abcdef"
        by default.
